# Serial Server

Transparently serve a serial port via TCP.

This project was motivated by the fact that I had to control a sizable power supply via a USB to serial adapter (FTDI chip), but did not want to be physically tethered to the power supply. This can be run on a lightweight device like a Raspberry Pi Zero W, making a serial device available via a WiFi network, for example.
